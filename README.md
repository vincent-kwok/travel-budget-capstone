BYTE - BUDGET YOUR TRAVEL EXPENSES
This app was built for my capstone project while attending Actualize Coding Bootcamp. 
The idea was created because I was traveling a lot at the time and I enjoy budgeting. 
However, all the (free) budgeting apps were limited in features or overloaded with ads.
I knew I wanted to create a budgeting app and while I was searching for a way to implement an API, I found one with flight data and decided to make the app catered towards budgeting for trips.
Initially, it was going to be a tool to find ticket and hotel prices so that a user would know how much they had left to spend on other categories.
Eventually, it turned into a way for users to create budgets based off prices and also keep track of their spending.
Some additions I'd like to work on are: 
 - improve airport search speed and results
 - CRUD the to-do list
 - upload receipts
 - add a map with ability to add points-of-interest
 
 Thank you for checking it out :)
